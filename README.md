# Test Mod
This is Minecraft Forge 1.6.4 mod that I use to test various things (mainly code for people in the Minecraft Forum [Modification Development](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/modification-development) section).

It's not supposed to be a complete or working mod.

# Notes
ForgeGradle 1.0 only supports Java 7.

If `JAVA_HOME` points to a different version of the JDK, launch Gradle with `gradlew_java7` instead of `gradlew` (only the Windows batch script is supplied, but it could be adapted to a Bash script).
